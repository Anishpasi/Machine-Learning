<h2>Heart_Prediction</h2>
Heart Disease Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type. The model was built using Python and scikit-learn, with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and performance evaluation using accuracy and other metrics. The goal is to support early detection and better healthcare decision-making.
